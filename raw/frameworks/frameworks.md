# Educational frameworks. What are they and why do we need them for education in the age of AI?
According to the Cambridge Dictionary, a framework is "a supporting structure around which something can be built." In the context of education, a framework serves as the foundation that determines how classes are structured, defining both the content knowledge and pedagogical tools applied in the classroom. However, educational frameworks are highly dependent on context and scale. They cannot simply be copied and pasted from one setting to another, as factors such as city size, school resources, socioeconomic disparities, student enrollment, available tools, and the capacities of both teachers and students will produce varying outcomes. For this reason, a robust educational framework should be multiscalar and modular, allowing it to adapt, within reasonable limits, to different environmental conditions while still producing meaningful results.
