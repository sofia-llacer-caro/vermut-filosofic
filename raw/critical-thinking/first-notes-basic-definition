## Core

My favourite ones:
- Purposeful, self-regulatory judgment which results in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, and inference, as well as explanation of the evidential, conceptual, methodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations upon which that judgment is based (Facione, Peter A. (2011). ["Critical Thinking: What It is and Why It Counts"](https://web.archive.org/web/20130729185619/http://www.insightassessment.com/CT-Resources/Teaching-For-and-About-Critical-Thinking/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts-PDF). insightassessment.com. p. 26. Archived from [the original](http://www.insightassessment.com/CT-Resources/Teaching-For-and-About-Critical-Thinking/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts/Critical-Thinking-What-It-Is-and-Why-It-Counts-PDF) on 29 July 2013. Retrieved 4 August 2012.).
- The skill and propensity to engage in an activity with reflective scepticism (Nieto, Ana M.; Saiz, Carlos (2010). "Critical Thinking: A Question of Aptitude and Attitude?". _Inquiry: Critical Thinking Across the Disciplines_. **25** (2). Philosophy Documentation Center: 19–26. [doi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doi_\(identifier\) "Doi (identifier)"):[10.5840/inquiryctnews20102524](https://doi.org/10.5840%2Finquiryctnews20102524). [ISSN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISSN_\(identifier\) "ISSN (identifier)") [1093-1082](https://search.worldcat.org/issn/1093-1082).).
- Critical thinking has seven critical features: being inquisitive and curious, being open-minded to different sides, being able to think systematically, being analytical, being persistent to truth, being confident about critical thinking itself, and lastly, being mature. (Facione, Peter A.; Facione, Noreen C. (March 1993). "Profiling critical thinking dispositions". _Assessment Update_. **5** (2): 1–4. [doi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doi_\(identifier\) "Doi (identifier)"):[10.1002/au.3650050202](https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fau.3650050202). [ISSN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISSN_\(identifier\) "ISSN (identifier)") [1041-6099](https://search.worldcat.org/issn/1041-6099).) **Interestingly enough, this last one has run a study with trials and defining parameters of measurement, which could be interesting as an inspiration for a quantitative study.**


A definition which is quite agreed upon:

> "Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action."

[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking#cite_note-33) This definition Ennis provided is highly agreed by Harvey Siegel,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking#cite_note-34) Peter Facione,[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking#cite_note-Facione_1%E2%80%934-29) and Deanna Kuhn.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking#cite_note-35)


Peter A. Facione seems to be a referential researcher and author in this area. Also John Dewey, who first coined the term and contemporarily opened the topic itself and highlighted it.

## Skills

The list of core critical thinking skills includes observation, interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, explanation, and [metacognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition "Metacognition"). Critical thinking employs not only [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") but broad [intellectual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellect "Intellect") criteria such as clarity, [credibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credibility "Credibility"), [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy "Accuracy"), precision, [relevance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance "Relevance"), depth, [breadth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth "Breadth"), significance, and fairness.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking#cite_note-39)
Critical thinking calls for the ability to:

- Recognize problems, to find workable means for meeting those problems
- Understand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem-solving
- Gather and marshal pertinent (relevant) information
- Recognize [unstated assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstated_assumption "Unstated assumption") and values
- Comprehend and use [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language") with accuracy, clarity, and [discernment](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/discernment "wikt:discernment")
- Interpret data, to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments
- Recognize the existence (or non-existence) of logical relationships between propositions
- Draw warranted conclusions and generalizations
- Put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives
- Reconstruct one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience
- Render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life

In education, [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey "John Dewey") is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner, the community, and [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy "Democracy").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking#cite_note-50)

> Kinds of mental acts and mental events that can occur in a critical thinking process: observing, feeling, wondering, imagining, inferring, knowledge, experimenting, consulting, identifying and analyzing arguments, judging, deciding.

These are basic mental actions which can be individually trained as abilities aiming at improving the overall critical thinking skills of an individual. If we think about it, one must have a clear understanding of basic concepts in each of them and have knowledge over aspects that can help them discern aspects such as: "what can be considered vague vs. precise?" for each of these skills.

> We can derive a short list of concepts whose understanding contributes to critical thinking from the critical thinking abilities described in the preceding section. Observational abilities require an understanding of the difference between observation and inference. Questioning abilities require an understanding of the concepts of ambiguity and vagueness. Inferential abilities require an understanding of the difference between conclusive and defeasible inference (traditionally, between deduction and induction), as well as of the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions. Experimenting abilities require an understanding of the concepts of hypothesis, null hypothesis, assumption and prediction, as well as of the concept of statistical significance and of its difference from importance. They also require an understanding of the difference between an experiment and an observational study, and in particular of the difference between a randomized controlled trial, a prospective correlational study and a retrospective (case-control) study. Argument analysis abilities require an understanding of the concepts of argument, premiss, assumption, conclusion and counter-consideration.

Teaching this knowledge can, in a way, help set the basis of these critical thinking skills from an educational point of view.
## Process
Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:
1. _suggestions_, in which the mind leaps forward to a possible solution;
2. an intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a _problem_ to be solved, a question for which the answer must be sought;
3. the use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or _hypothesis_, to initiate and guide observation and other operations in collection of factual material;
4. the mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or supposition (_reasoning_, in the sense on which reasoning is a part, not the whole, of inference); and
5. testing the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey 1933: 106–107; italics in original)
(Note that here it could be interesting to look into psychological bias like confirmation bias etc as common mistakes type of thing.)
